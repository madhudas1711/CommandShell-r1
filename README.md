Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
--------------
CDAP version 4.2.x or higher.

Building Plugins
----------------
You get started with File Contents action plugin by building directly from the latest source code::

   git clone git@github.com:hydrator/&lt;artifact-id&gt;.git
   cd &lt;plugin-directory&gt;
   mvn clean package

After the build completes, you will have a JAR for each plugin under each
``<plugin-name>/target/`` directory.

Deploying Plugins
-----------------
You can deploy a plugin using the CDAP CLI::

  > load artifact &lt;target/plugin-jar&gt; config-file <resources/plugin-config>

  > load artifact target/&lt;artifact-id&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.jar \
         config-file target/&lt;artifact-id&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.json

You can build without running tests: ``mvn clean install -DskipTests``
